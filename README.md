## Warcraft 3 Replay Analysis

Deployed on Heroku at https://war3-hackday.herokuapp.com/

## What is it? 
As part of my hackday, I created 5 Datadog screenboards for Warcraft 3 Replay Analysis 1v1 Pro Ladder games.  
I downloaded my replay packs from https://warcraft3.info/replays and saved them locally into a folder inside my app.

## Application
All of my code is located in the `app/` folder of the repository.   
I used https://brettlangdon.github.io/node-dogapi/ to gather my metrics.  

These 2 articles helped me in the process:  
- [How to change the colors of my dashboards? Reverse Color Scheme - Martin Fejoz](https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/203345119-How-to-change-the-colors-of-my-dashboards-Reverse-Color-Scheme)  
- [How do I exclude certain tags from a graph or monitor? - Samantha Drago](https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/204520129-How-do-I-exclude-certain-tags-from-a-graph-or-monitor-)

## Flow
[Saved Replays Locally](https://warcraft3.info/replays)   
--> [w3g package returns JSON data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/w3g)   
--> [Parser to include only Metrics I need](app/parser.js) + [Parse by Race](app/raceParser.js)  
--> [Submit metrics](app/index.js)  
--> [Serve to Heroku](app/server.js)

## Dependencies

- DogAPI v2.8.3 --> Send Metrics to Datadog from my Node app
- dotenv v6.1.0 --> Hide my Application/API keys
- express v4.16.4 --> Run my server onto Heroku
- nodemon v1.18.4 --> Automatically restart server whenever there are changes in my code
- pug v2.0.3 --> Front end HTML template
- w3g v1.0.3 --> w3g replay parser

## JSON Items Parsed and sent as Metrics
I then parsed the replay into JSON objects that I needed including
  - Heroes
  - Actions per Minute (APM)
  - Race
  - Units
  - Game Length

Missing Categories that I would have liked
  - Resources, such as Gold and Wood
  - Win/Loss

List of metrics sent:

```
war3.apm
war3.gameLength
war3.total_games
war3.rdm
war3.hu
war3.hu.peasant
war3.hu.footman
war3.hu.rifleman
war3.hero.am
war3.hero.bm
war3.hero.mk

war3.ne.huntress
war3.ne.hero.dh
war3.ne.hero.kotg
war3.ne.hero.potm
war3.ne.hero.wd
```

## Tags
I then tagged each individual replay with a player-name. Example `player:ben`.  
In this way, in my screenboards I could create Template Variables to see the stats of each player.

## Moving Forward
- Save replays into a database instead of saving it locally
- Add a section for **Hero Abilities + Levels + Items, Resources (Gold + Wood), Advanced Units**

## Bugs
1) When I downloaded replay packs, certain replays consistently returned this error:
```
replay /Users/ben.basuni/Desktop/war3-hackday/replays/000.w3g
/Users/ben.basuni/Desktop/war3-hackday/app/parser.js:21
  let getValOf = v => v[Object.keys(v)[0]];
                               ^
TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
```

I didn't spend too much time debugging this, but if I were to guess, I think the error occurs whenever there is no one spectating. Usually in pro games, they almost always play with a moderator or someone spectating. I'm guessing that in the case where there are no moderators, this errors out.

2) APM & players are returning only once. As you can see in the **Overview** Board - **Top 10 APM** Graph & **Race** Board - **Top 10 Players** Graph, all the APMs are precise numbers (ending with .00). This isn't taking into account 2 or 3 replays, since there is a very minimal chance that these players consistently hit the same (ex: 350 APM) every single game.

Troubleshooting how I am submitting these metrics is the way to go from here.
